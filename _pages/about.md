Iâ€™m Devon Moffett, a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science at University of California Merced. My work focuses on institutions which, like many things in life, are most interesting at their extremities. Through viewing the outlines of the conceptual and empirical space they occupy, I believe we finally begin to get an idea of the leviathans that we live alongside. Particularly interesting to me are those institutions associated with elections and accountability; these two narrative tokens tie many of the core machines of modern society together, and remaining in that domain is productive in the sense that each new investigation produces insights complementary with the last.
